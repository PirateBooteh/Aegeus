Replace the IPs in IPs.txt with the IP(s) of your VPS(s). The first "column" of text should be the Masternode number (01, 02, 03, etc) and the second "column" of text should be the IP address of your VPS (123.123.123.123). Continue adding IPs in this manner so the checker will check all of your nodes.

The IPs.txt and python file need to be in the same folder. Tweaking can be done to utilize an absolute path, but for ease of use I removed that in this version so people would only need to keep them in the same folder. If there are any issues, hit me up in the Aegeus Discord.
